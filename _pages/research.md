## Magnetar-powered SNe and Their Binary Origins.

One of the most popular central engine models for type Ic superluminous SNe (SLSNe), broad-lined type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL) associated or unassociated with long GRBs, and some fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) is the magnetar central engine. By combing results of ejecta masses and magnetar rotational energy for these magnetar-driven SNe, we found a strong universal relationship between them, indicating magnetar-driven SNe could share a common origin. With detailed binary simulations and population synthesis simulations, we found that helium stars in close binaries can be tidally spun up by main-sequence or compact-object companions and these systems can form via the classic common-envelope channel.

Observations have revealed that the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe are diverse, showing characteristics such as multiple post-peak bumps, late-time broad hydrogen lines, and polarization evolution. We proposed that a close binary origin could naturally explain this diversity. Specifically, we suggested that the wind from a newborn magnetar may significantly evaporate its main-sequence companion if the binary system is not disrupted after SN. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material and ejecta by the magnetar wind could produce post-peak bumps, which fits well with many bumpy SLSN lightcurves. This "magnetarâ€“star binary engine" model may offer a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.
