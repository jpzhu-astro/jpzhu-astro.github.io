## Magnetar-powered SNe and Their Binary Origins.

Type Ib/Ic SNe originate from the core collapse of stars. Their ejecta kinetic energy is generally provided by neutrinos, while their radiation energy is typically thought to be powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co. However, exceptionally energetic type Ic SNe, including type Ic superluminous SNe (SLSNe), broad-lined type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL) associated or unassociated with long GRBs, and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), show kinetic and/or radiative energies significantly exceeding those of ordinary Ib/Ic SNe. This suggests that the classical core-collapse mechanism may not fully account for their explosions, suggesting instead to the possibility of additional energy injection mechanisms. One of the most popular models is the magnetar central engine, which proposes that a millisecond magnetar can form during core collapse and subsequently deposits its rotational energy to heat and accelerate the ejecta. 

Since the peak emissions of SLSNe and some FBOTs are significantly brighter than those powered by $^{56}$Ni, in \cite{yu2017} and \cite{liu2022}, we used the magnetar engine to fit lightcurves from the literature, obtaining the distributions of magnetar parameters (rotational energy $E_{\rm rot,i}$ and magnetic field strength) and ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$. For SNe Ic-BL, magnetars rapidly transfer energy to the ejecta, contributing to their kinetic energies while having a limited effect on emissions. Therefore, one can directly use the measured ejecta kinetic energy to determine the magnetar rotational energy. By combing results from these SNe, shown in Figure \ref{fig:M_ej_E_rot}, we found a strong universal relationship between $E_{\rm rot,i}$ and $M_{\rm ej}$ in \cite{liu2022}, indicating they could share a common origin. In \cite{hu2023} with detailed binary simulation code \texttt{MESA}, we found that helium stars in close binaries can be tidally spun up by main-sequence or compact-object companions. In such systems, higher-mass stars can have larger cores, allowing more angular momentum to be stored in the collapsing core that forms a magnetar, naturally producing the observed universal $E_{\rm rot,i}-M_{\rm ej}$ relationship. Our population synthesis simulations suggested these systems can form via the classic common-envelope channel, consistent with the observed rate densities of these magnetar-driven SNe.

Observations have revealed that the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe are diverse, showing characteristics such as multiple post-peak bumps, late-time broad H$\alpha$ lines, and polarization evolution. In \cite{zhu2024SLSN}, we proposed that a close binary origin could naturally explain this diversity. Specifically, we suggested that the wind from a newborn magnetar may significantly evaporate its main-sequence companion if the binary system is not disrupted after SN (see Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}or an overview of the physical processes). The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material and ejecta by the magnetar wind could produce post-peak bumps, which fits well with many bumpy SLSN lightcurves. After the photosphere penetrates deeply into the ejecta, broad H$\alpha$ lines can be identified when the ejecta behind the evaporated material becomes optically thin, and polarization evolution can be observed because the equatorial plane contains more material and move slower. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" further supports our proposition in \cite{hu2023} that SLSNe may originate from close-orbit binary systems.
