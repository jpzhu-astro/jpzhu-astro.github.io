My name is Jin-Ping Zhu (朱锦平). I am an OzGrav postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Physics & Astronomy at Monash University, Australia. I received my Ph.D degree in Astronomy from Peking University at Beijing in 2022 and my B.S. degree in Physics from Central China Normal University at Wuhan in 2017.

Research Interests
======
* Multi-messenger (gravitational waves,  neutrinos, and electromagnetic radiation) astrophysics 
* Electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources (kilonovae, short gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron mergers and neutron star--black hole mergers, transients associated with neutron star--white dwarf mergers)
* Gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, kilonovae, accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, fast radio bursts
* Compact object coalescences and supernovae embedded in AGN accretion disks
* Detailed binary evolution and population synthesis simulation
* Testing fundamental physics
