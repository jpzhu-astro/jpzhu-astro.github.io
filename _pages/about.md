I am an OzGrav postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Physics & Astronomy at Monash University, Australia. 


Research Interests
======
* Multi-messenger (gravitational waves,  neutrinos, and electromagnetic radiation) astrophysics 
* Electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources (kilonovae, short gamma-ray bursts associated with binary neutron mergers and neutron star--black hole mergers, transients assoicated with neutron star--white dwarf mergers)
* Gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, kilonovae, fast radio bursts
* Compact object coalescences and supernovae embedded in AGN accretion disks
* Detailed binary evolution and population synthesis simulation
* Testing fundamental physics
